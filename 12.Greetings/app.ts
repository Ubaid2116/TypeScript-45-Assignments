// Question-12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName = ["Hammad", "Muqeet", "Awais", "Zohaib"];
friendsName.forEach(friendName => console.log(`Hello ${friendName}, will you come to the birthday party tomorrow?`));
